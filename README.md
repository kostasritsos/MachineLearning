Task 1
Use the family of models f(x, θ) = θ0 + θ1 · x1 + θ2 · x2 + θ3 · sin(x2) + θ4 · x1 · x2 to fit the
data.
a. Write in the report the formula of the model substituting parameters θ0, . . . , θ4 with
the estimates you’ve found:

f(x, θ) = _ + _ · x1 + _ · x2 + _ · sin(x2) + _ · x1 · x2

b. Evaluate the test performance of your model using the mean squared error as
performance measure.
Task 2
Consider any family of non-linear models of your choice to address the above regression
problem.
a. Evaluate the test performance of your model using the mean squared error as
performance measure.
